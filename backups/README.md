# Local backup and restore

Local backup and restore of Zimbra accounts and settings by executing scripts with a lot of options.

## Install

Clone me into */usr/share/zimbra-scripts/* and do symbolic links for the .sh files to */usr/bin/local/*.

Or use install scripts located in ../install/.

        [Example] -s /Briefcase/movies -s '/Inbox/list-.*' -s '.*/nobackup'
  
      -l
        Lock the accounts just before starting to backup them
        Locks are NOT removed after the backup: useful when reinstalling the server
        [Default] Not locked
  
    ENVIRONMENT
  
      -b path
        Where to save the backups
        [Default] /tmp/zimbra_backups
  
      -p path
        Main path of the Zimbra installation
        [Default] /opt/zimbra
  
      -u user
        Zimbra UNIX user
        [Default] zimbra
  
      -g group
        Zimbra UNIX group
        [Default] zimbra
  
    PARTIAL BACKUPS
  
      -i ASSET
        Do a partial backup by selecting groups of settings/data
        [Default] Everything is backuped
  
        [Example] Backup full server configuration without user data:
          -i server_settings -i accounts_settings
        [Example] Backup accounts but not the configuration of the server itself:
          -i accounts_settings -i accounts_data
  
        ASSET can be:
          server_settings
            Backup server-side settings (ie. domains, mailing lists, admins list, etc)
          accounts_settings
            Backup accounts settings (ie. identity, password, aliases, signatures, filters, etc)
          accounts_data
            Backup accounts data (ie. folders, mails, contacts, calendars, briefcase, tasks, etc)
  
    OTHERS
  
      -d LEVEL
        Enable debug mode
        [Default] Disabled
  
        LEVEL can be:
          1
            Show debug messages
          2
            Show level 1 information plus Zimbra commands
          3
            Show level 2 information plus Bash commands (xtrace)
  
      -h
        Show this help
  
    EXAMPLES
  
      (1) Backup everything in /tmp/mybackups/
            zimbra-backup.sh -b /tmp/mybackups/
  
      (2) When backuping the mailboxes, the data inside every folder named "nobackup" will be ignored.
          Ask to your users to create an IMAP folder named "nobackup" and to put inside all their
          non-important emails (even in subfolders). Ask for the same thing but with their files in the
          Briefcase. Involve them in the issues raised by the cost of the space allocated for the backups!
            zimbra-backup.sh -b /tmp/mybackups/ -s '.*/nobackup'
  
      (3) Backup everything from the server, but only with the accounts of jdoe@example.com and jfoo@example.org
            zimbra-backup.sh -b /tmp/mybackups/ -m jdoe@example.com -m jfoo@example.org
  
      (4) Backup only the stuff related to the account of jdoe@example.com and nothing else
            zimbra-backup.sh -b /tmp/mybackups/ -i accounts_settings -i accounts_data -m jdoe@example.com
